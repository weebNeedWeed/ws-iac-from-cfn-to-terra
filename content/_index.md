# Infrastructure as Code: From CloudFormation to Terraform

#### Overview

In this lab, you will learn the basis of **AWS CloudFormation** and **Terraform**, two tools that enable you to provision AWS resources by defining a file called *template*. In a template, you specify the resources you need, the properties for each resource and the location you want those resources to be deployed. CloudFormation and Terraform will interpret your template and generate your resources automatically.
